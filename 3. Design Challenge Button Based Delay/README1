The way this code works is when the 2.3 button is pressed, the green LED will turn on to let you know the 
system is counting, and when the button is released, the green LED will turn off and the red LED
will blink for the time the button was held


This is accomplished in the same manner as part 1 in that when the interrupt is fired, it will check to see 
if a rising or falling edge triggered the interrupt.  If it was a falling edge (button pressed) it sets the 
control variable to 1 where in the main function i will start counting up.  When the rising edge is detected
(button released) the capture control register is set to the value of i so the LED will blink for as long as 
the button was held.
