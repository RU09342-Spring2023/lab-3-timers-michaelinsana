The way this code works is when the 2.3 button is not pressed, the red LED will blink and when
the button is pressed, the green LED will blink


This is accomplished by using if statements in the interruot that will detect if a rising or 
falling edge triggered the interrupt.  If triggered by a falling edge (button pressed) the LED
color variable is switched as well as the interrupt edge select which will make the interrupt 
fire off when a rising edge (button released) happens.
